# QLearningLineTracer
Schoolwork using QLearning for robot to trace line

## Please Read
Work is not perfect and has some flaws so the learning might go sour.  :(

## Learning vs Result
MyRobot contains learning process and result whereas Result_R* contains only result after learning process.

Result_R* is the program used to run on real robot (legos) thus only result is needed (learning in reality consume large amount of time).
Each number represents a map.

## Execute command
